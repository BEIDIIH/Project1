## Project 1
#### by Beidi Han


### Overview
This is the first project of Interaction Design class. 


### Modifying

(1) Added the PNG files in the assets folder.

(2) Add custom drawing code to different drawFunctions

(3) Create the route from page to page

### Technical information

Since I have built about ten pages, I have a very long code to organize. This is the most difficult point for me. Even if I made a note, my coding interface is still very messy. In addition, I don't know how to simply enter paragraphs in p5.js. If you want to control the number of words per line by yourself, I think this is a very cumbersome process.
